<h2>Requirements:</h2> An xbox <br>
And a laptop/pc <br>
if you want to make the process faster you can use a USB<br>
Durango FTP (on xbox)<br>
Filezilla (on computer)<br>
<br>
<h3>step 1</h3>
<img src=part1.jfif width=750 height=450 />
<br>
<p> it should look like the image above when you run RetroArch, go to <em>online updater</em> and update <strong>assets</strong> and <strong>databases</strong></p><br>
<br>
<h3>step 2.0</h3>
<img src=part1.1.jfif width=750 height=450 />
<p>this is what it should look like after you have updated the assets and databases, you can update everything else if you want <br>
but you don't need to untill later.
<br>
Go to <strong>Settings > Input > Hotkeys > Menu Toggle Controller Combo > Set whatever you want 
2.1) Main Menu > Configuration File > Save Current Config</strong> to set a quick menu combination. <br>
this allows you to access a quick menu in the game that allows you to save state or load state or change the controls.
<br>
<h3><strong>Step 3</strong></h3>
<p>step 3 is how to get Roms internally on your xbox without usb, if you want to use a USB skip step 3
(if you are on xbox one there is a 16GB limit, for series X or S there is a 30GB limit) <br>
3.1 Download Roms onto your pc/laptop (i cannot provide any Rom sites as it is illegal but they are easy to find) <br> 
or you can dump your own games onto your pc/laptop, once you have your Rom installed on your computer you need durango FTP on your xbox to transfer it to xbox, get Durango FTP from my website <a href="file:///C:/Users/tommy/Desktop/Html/change.html">here</a>
<p>step 3.2 you need the cores and the bios for the emulators, you can find all of the bios yourself, or you can download them from <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eR0GxARLzPkY4E0sQqEtMg5w-5pQ80pS?usp=sharing">here </a> by downloading the "system" folder<br
so now you should have your bios and your Roms, now go onto Durango FTP and it should look something like this
<br>
<img src=Durangoftp2.jpg width=750 height=450 />
<br>
<p>step 3.3 open up FileZilla, you can download it from <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">here </a></p><br>
once you have <strong>FileZilla</strong>installed open it. it should look like this
<br>
<img src=Filezilla.png width=750 height=450 /><br>
<br>
step 3.4 there should be 4 boxes on the top of the screen such as host,username,password and port. You can find this on <strong>Durango FTP</strong> on the right side of the screen. <br>
<em>"host"</em> means the ip (example 192.168.1.220) type your ip (found in Durango FTP) into the host box<br>
step 3.5 in durango FTP in the boxes you do <strong>not</strong>need to type anything in username and password and in "port" type 21, then tick the box that says "allow anonymous" and press start<br>
<br>
<strong>step 3.6</strong> in Filezilla type in  and 21 for the port and click "quick-connect" (you do not need to put anything for username and password)
<br>
once done and guessing you have connected to your xbox it should look like this:
<br>
<img src=Filezilla2.png width=750 height=450 /> <br>
<p>to put your system folder into place you need to go to LOCALSTATE look for a folder that has rather "retroarch" or "tommywats" in the name. </p><br>
then go to Localstate and replace the system folder with your new one.
and while your there put your roms in "downloads"<br>
<strong>step3.7</strong> go back onto retroarch>online updater and update everything. Then go to <strong>"import content"</strong> and <strong"scan directory"</strong> then <strong>"Q"</strong> (which should be at the bottom) <br>
then "downloads" and then "scan this directory"<br>
<br>
<img src=games.jpg width=750 height=450 /> <br
<p> this press on the game you wanna play and press "play" and it should run fine, and if you want to change the controls thats what the menu toggle combination was for ealier.
